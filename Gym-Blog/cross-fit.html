            <p class="card-text">CrossFit was founded in 2001 and can be used to accomplish any goal, from improved health to better performance. 
              CrossFit is so effective it may feel like magic, but in truth, it’s a formula — a formula that works.

      <h2><b>The 10 Most Important CrossFit Exercises</b></h2>
        <hr>

      <h3><b>1.SNATCH</b></h3>
      <img src="Images/snatch.webp" class="card-img" alt="...">
      <p><h5>Learning the Snatch technique is one of the hardest skills to master. It contrasts with the clean and jerk, in that it favours the athleticism attributed to a gymnastic body-type over the ‘gym-bro’, who may be struggling to learn the snatch after years spent believing that parallel squats were the lowest one could possibly go, and the overhead squat was a mere fairytale.</h5></p>
      <hr>

      <h3><b>2.Important CrossFit Exercises – CLEAN</b></h3>
      <img src="Images/clean.webp" class="card-img" alt="...">
      <p><h5> Clean is a lift that requires power, posture, skill and strength. Here is how to do it properly, break through plateaus, and raise your lifts to the next level.</h5></></p>
      <hr>

      <h3><b>3.Important CrossFit Exercises – FRONT SQUAT</b></h3>
      <img src="Images/front-squat.webp" class="card-img" alt="...">
      <p><h5>The Front Squat has always been a staple exercise in Olympic weightlifting programs, as it serves as the base for the catch position in the clean. But since people tend to lift more weight with Back Squats and may find keeping the rack position of the bar difficult, front squats are often neglected.<br>
        When done correctly, Front Squats will:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>Increase the depth of the movement</li>
        <li>Improve core strength</li>
        <li>Activate glutes</li>
        <li>Improve related exercises such as Thrusters or Squat Cleans</li>
        <li>Build Strength</li>
        </ul>
        </h5></p>
        <hr>

      <h3><b>4.BACK SQUAT</b></h3>
      <img src="Images/crossfit-male-back-squat.webp" class="card-img" alt="...">
      <p><h5>The right breathing, bracing setup, and technique throughout the movement will help you stay tight and lift BIG in the squat: The KING of strength exercises.</h5></p>
      <hr>

      <h3><b>5.Important CrossFit Exercises – OVERHEAD PRESS</b></h3>
      <img src="Images/Overhead-Press.webp" class="card-img" alt="...">
      <p><h5>The Overhead Press (also known as the Strict Press or Shoulder Press) is a compound exercise that involves lifting a weighted barbell overhead to a fully locked out position with the strict use of the shoulders and arms.<br>
        Pressing the bar overhead is still one of the most useful upper body exercises you can do. This highly effective exercise involves the entire body. Your feet, legs, glutes, core, abs, hips, ankles and wrists help to stabilise the body whilst your shoulders, upper chest, back and arms press the bar overhead.
        </h5></p>
        <hr>

      <h3><b>6.BENCH PRESS</b></h3>
      <img src="Images/crossfit-bench-press.webp" class="card-img" alt="...">
      <p><h5> bench press is not a common exercise in Crossfit, yet it can be a great way to build power and improve lock out strength and overhead press movements for other lifts.</h5></p>
      <hr>

      <h3><b>7.DEADLIFT</b></h3>
      <img src="Images/deadlift-crossfit-male-athlete.webp" class="card-img" alt="...">
      <p><h3 style="color:blue;">"THERE IS NO REASON TO BE ALIVE IF YOU CAN’T DO DEADLIFT”</h3></p>
      <hr>

      <h3><b>8.BURPEES</b></h3>
      <img src="Images/burpees.jpg" class="card-img" alt="...">
      <p><h5>There are so many fun, exciting exercises with barbells or challenging gymnastics skills, and then there are burpees…</h5></p>
      <hr>

      <h3><b>9.ROPE CLIMBING</b></h3>
      <img src="Images/rope-climb.webp" class="card-img" alt="...">
      <p><h5>The truth behind Rope Climbs is that they require only a reasonable level of upper body and grip strength. Great technique will allow you to generate force with your legs and propel you up the rope in a highly efficient way!</h5></p>
      <hr>

      <h3><b>10.THRUSTER</b></h3>
      <img src="Images/thruster.webp" class="card-img" alt="...">
      <p><h5>A combined front squat and push press, this punishing exercise can be a real killer!</h5></p>
