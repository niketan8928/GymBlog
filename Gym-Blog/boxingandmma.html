        <h2 >MMA Workout Routine You Can Do At Home</h2>

        <p>Have you ever wanted to train in mixed martial arts? You might not be able to get to a gym regularly like the professional fighters competing at the highest level but that doesn’t matter, you can achieve an adequate MMA workout from home. Thanks to the internet and the numerous free resources that now exist, finding MMA specific workouts and exercising like a pro-athlete has never been easier.</p>
        <p>Training for MMA is a great way to achieve a solid workout, raise your heart rate, burn fat, and build your fighting skills – all of which lead to a healthier overall mindset day-to-day. You may need some equipment initially but that is also easy to acquire once you’re willing to make that initial investment.</p> 
        <p>The best MMA fighters typically train five or six days per week and usually do multiple sessions in one day. Of course, as professional athletes, these fighters are not inhibited in the same way as a beginner would be. If you want to train for MMA then a workout at home is a great way to start improving your fitness and stamina, which will assist you in the transition towards training full time – if that’s what you wish to achieve.</p>
        <p>The work you do at home will include different types of martial arts so you can tailor your experience and train like your favourite MMA fighters. This guide should help you create a solid plan for an MMA workout routine which will get you in shape.</p>
        <p>Variety is the spice of life and the freedom that comes from studying MMA at home allows you to test whatever waters you please, giving you a better idea of what works for you and what doesn’t. If you’re specifically loving drilling muay-thai techniques, you can choose to center your workouts around it. It’s a luxury that you likely won’t find when you enroll in a gym and one that stands as a major benefit planning your MMA exercise at home.</p>

        <h4>MMA Training at Home</h4>
        <p>To train in MMA at home, you’ll need to get some basic equipment in order to get the best from your MMA workout routine. While not everything listed is completely essential, here’s a list of training equipment worth getting to start you off on the right track:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Training Mats</li>
          <li>Weights</li>
          <li>Boxing Bag / Heavy Bag / Thai Bag</li>
          <li>Gloves(Boxing/MMA/Thai)</li>
          <li>Shin Guards</li>
          <li>Striking Pads</li>
          <li>Grappling Dummy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may be working on your own or you may have a partner – this will determine what equipment you need for your workouts. Grappling dummies are a great tool to replicate a body but can be expensive. And while nothing can beat the real thing, there are many solo drills that you can perform without a dummy or a training partner.</p>
        <p>Mats allow you to train comfortably barefoot and also to protect your body from harsh impact if you are grappling. Getting mats for the home is highly recommended as it protects your floor when doing exercise from sweat and fluid.</p>
        <p>There are many different types of gloves and all have different uses, if you are using a heavy bag then opt for a glove with more protection. If you are a novice to the world of kicks, then shin-pads are an absolute must in order to protect you from any injuries that may hinder your progress.</p>

        <h4>MMA Exercises at Home – Step By Step Guide</h4>
        <p>Let’s get started with your workout – we are going to split this into 2 different MMA workout routines. One workout will be MMA conditioning focused and the other will be technique focused. You may want to perform each workout on separate days or if you can then try them both on the same day.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Warm-Up</h4>
        <p>Essential for any MMA workout routine is a warm-up – we suggest that performing mobility exercise and light cardiovascular exercise is the best way to prepare yourself for a session.</p>
        <p>1.Mobility Routine – this involves movement of all the major joints in the body and stretching in preparation. Spend as long as you need with this step until your body feels prepared for the next.</p>
        <p>2.Shadowboxing – 3 rounds of 30 seconds of shadow boxing will serve to raise your heart rate ahead of the more intense exercises to be found in this guide.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Conditioning Workout</h4>
        <p>It is important that a conditioning workout realistically mimics actual MMA preparation in terms of the type of exercises selected and the amount of time that you will work for. Below there are 5 exercises that will make you work for 45 seconds and rest of 15 seconds before moving on to the next one. This helps to create short intense bursts of exercise that develop your cardio and power. The short rest time represents the moments in a fight where there may be a break in the fighting while you move around the ring. Perform this circuit as many times as you would like. We suggest 3 rounds, to begin with.</p>
        <p>For each exercise, put in 45 seconds work, followed by 15 seconds rest. Repeat this cycle for 3-5 rounds.</p>
        <p>After each full round of doing all the exercises make sure to have a 1-minute rest in between rounds.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Squat Jumps</li>
          <li>Press Ups</li>
          <li>Heavy Bag</li>
          <li>Pull-Ups or Bicep Curl</li>
          <li>Burpees</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This workout is designed to incorporate the full body and use of external weight and bodyweight to allow you to improve your power and overall fitness.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Technique Workout</h4>
        <p>This workout will be broken into 3 different sections which focus on different striking disciplines. Muay thai and boxing and a separate grappling workout.</p>
        <p>For the striking element work on a heavy bag as it will stay rigid when you strike – something that can assist you in developing power. Mastering the basic techniques in both stances is a great way of exercising and also learning striking for MMA. Many fighters these days, such as Tony Ferguson, Jorge Masvidal, and Jon Jones can operate in both stances which makes them a more difficult and unpredictable opponent to face.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of some boxing and kickboxing sequences to go through:</p>
        <p>Boxing techniques – perform in 5-minute rounds focusing on controlled technique. Have a break in between rounds of 1 minute.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1-2 (Jab-Cross)</li>
          <li>1-1-2 (Jab-Jab-Cross)</li>
          <li>1-2-3 (Jab-Cross-Lead hook)</li>
          <li>1-2-3-2 (Jab-Cross-Lead Hook-Cross)</li>
          <li>1-2-5-2 (Jab-Cross-Lead Uppercut-Cross)</li>
          <li>1-6-3-2 (Jab-Rear Uppercut-Lead hook-Cross)</li>
          <li>2-3-2 (Cross-Lead Hook-Cross)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Kickboxing techniques – perform in 5-minute rounds focusing on controlled technique. Have a break in between rounds of 1 minute.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Jab-Rear Leg Kick</li>
          <li>Cross-Lead Leg kick</li>
          <li>Jab-Rear Head kick</li>
          <li>Cross-Lead Head kick</li>
          <li>Jab-Overhand</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Grappling techniques – solo drills or dummy drills are a great way to exercise and move like a grappler. There is a great free resource from John Danaher available to download and focuses entirely on solo drills (4). Follow these simple exercises to complete your grappling workout. Perform 10 repetitions of each, work in a circuit, and repeat 3-5 times.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Sprawls</li>
        <li>Forward Rolls</li>
        <li>JBackward Rolls</li>
        <li>Shrimps</li>
        <li>Bear Crawls</li>
        <li>Sit throughs</li>
        <li>Triangle setups</li>
     </ul>
     <p>If you have any difficulty with the exercise then there are a lot of good resources and technique videos on youtube which can help you to master the basics of solo grappling exercise </p>

     <h3>What exercises do MMA fighters do?</h3>
     <p>MMA fighters are among the very best conditioned athletes on the planet. Their training programs tend to mix sparring, technique drilling, and strength + conditioning workouts and for the most part, everything will be ramped up in its intensity during a fight-camp (which will generally last for about 8-10 weeks).</p>
     <p>With a heavy emphasis on metabolic conditioning-based workouts, the goal for all fighters is to develop every type of functional strength imaginable – something that will allow them to deal with the multi-faceted demands of an MMA fight.</p>
     <p>This guide can help you take your first steps towards an MMA workout routine at home. It could aid you in progressing your MMA experience towards starting joining a gym. Whatever you choose to do we hope this information allows you to improve your speed, endurance, core strength, and overall performance.</p>
     <p>So with that being said, all that remains is for you to take the first step down this incredibly rewarding path, a path that could well prove to be a life-altering experience for you in the long-run. If planned and executed correctly, sticking to an MMA workout routine at home can be just as beneficial to you mentally as it is physically – leading to a happier and healthier vessel for this near-limitless supply of information.</p>
