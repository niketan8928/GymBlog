        <h2><b>Shoulder Builder #1 – Barbell Overhead Press</b></h2>
        <img src="images/over_head.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>The barbell overhead press strengthens all three heads of the deltoid — the front (anterior), middle (lateral), and rear (posterior). If you want bigger, stronger, and boulder shoulders, overhead pressing variations are necessary for size and strength because shoulder raise variations will only take you so far.</p>
        <p>With the bar right in front of you, place your hands just outside your shoulders. Your elbows and forearms should be in a vertical position, stacked upon each other. If your elbows are pointing out or in, your grip is either too narrow or too wide. Please adjust accordingly.

          Put the bar on the heel of your palm because this is where you’ll generate the most force from.  Press overhead until lockout and slowly lower down to the starting position and repeat.
          
          </p>
        
        <h2><b>Shoulder Builder #2 – Lateral raise</b></h2>
        <img src="images/lateral_raise.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Dumbbell Lateral Raise. Keep your abs tight, chest up and shoulders back. With your head straight, hold the dumbbells at your sides with a neutral grip. Without using momentum, raise the dumbbells out to your sides in a wide arc, keeping your elbows and hands moving together in the same plane.</p>

        <h2><b>Shoulder Builder #3 – Front Raise</b></h2>
        <img src="images/front_raise.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>The best front raise is an isolation shoulder flexion exercise, which works the muscles in the sides and front of the shoulders. This exercise helps you gain the strength you need to lift objects safely. Physical therapists often recommend this exercise to improve shoulder and neck strength, and can help reduce neck pain as well.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Shoulder Builder #4 – Upright Row</b></h2>
        <img src="images/upright_row.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Upright rows have a reputation as a shoulder destroyer, but like anything, it's all about how you perform them. As personal trainer Jimmy Peña explains in the article, "How Wide Should My Grip Be on an Upright Row," don't take a close grip, which can internally rotate your shoulders. Instead, take a wider grip where your upper arms go directly out to your sides.</p>
        <p>The science backs this up, too. A wider grip has been demonstrated to both significantly increase delt activation and also minimizing the biceps' role in the movement. You can also perform these one arm at a time to get the same effect. </p>
