        <br>
        
        <h2><b>Chest Builder #1 – The Bench Press</b></h2>
        <img src="images/bench_press.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>No surprise here, the bench press is the #1 exercise you should be incorporating into your routine if you want to build a broad, powerful looking chest. Doing the bench press with proper technique allows you to generate a tremendous amount of power and move a lot of weight, leading to a bigger, stronger chest.</p>
        <p>Now the bench press is a fairly complex movement and you want to make sure you have a solid understanding of the technique so you can consistently generate maximum power without risking injury.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Chest Builder #2 – Incline Bench Press</b></h2>
        <img src="images/incline_bench_press.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Can you tell I like barbell movements?

            That’s because barbell weight training allows you to add enough weight to the bar to significantly overload your muscles and give them a catalyst to grow.</p>
        <p>The incline bench press, like the flat bench press, also engages the pectoralis major, anterior deltoid, triceps, and serratus.</p>

        <h2><b>Chest Builder #3 – Dips</b></h2>
        <img src="images/chest_dips.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Dips are my favorite exercise for emphasizing the development of the lower chest. It’s important to note that I use the word “emphasize” here because like the other chest exercises on this list, dips work the entire chest, triceps, and front deltoids. But the specialty of dips is targeting the lower chest.</p>
        <p>The more the chest is angled forward during the dip, the more the exercise targets the chest. On the other hand, the more vertically upright you are during the movement, the more the exercise the targets the triceps.</p>

        <h2><b>Chest Builder #4 – The Chest Fly</b></h2>
        <img src="images/chest_fly.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>The chest fly is an isolation exercise which targets the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, deltoids, triceps, and biceps, although the focus is mainly on the pectorals. In addition to building chest muscle, the chest fly helps to open up the chest and shoulders which can reduce tightness, increase range of motion, and combat poor posture.</p>
        <p>Where the bench press is great for building strength and power, chest flyes are really suited to building size, so if your goal is a bigger chest, add them into your routine. Different variations work the muscles in a slightly different way, so you may want to add a few variations. As an isolation exercise, this is best suited as a finisher.
