        <br>
        
        <h2><b>Back Builder #1 – Deadlift</b></h2>
        <img src="images/deadlift.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>This mighty pull is far more than a back exercise. It hits the entire posterior chain, from your calves to your upper traps, but it's also a time-tested standout for overall backside development.</p>
        <p>And no, it's not just for powerlifters! Legendary bodybuilder Jay Cutler builds his back day around deadlifts, as well. Technique is uber-important, but once you nail it, you can progress to lifting monster weights that recruit maximum muscle, release muscle-building hormones, and help you get big.</p>
        

        <h2><b>Back Builder #2 – Bent-Over Row</b></h2>
        <img src="images/bent-over-row.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>This is a total back-builder: upper back, lower back, lats, traps, spinal erectors—the whole deal. And the science backs it up. It's a staple of the best back workouts for men, but make no mistake, it's great for back workouts for women, as well.</p>
        <p>Do heavy bent-over rows toward the start of your back workout in lower rep ranges, such as 6-8 or 8-10, in order to save your lower back. If you're wrecked from deadlifts, skip it or do it on a second back day later in the week.</p>



        <h2><b>Back Builder #3 – Lat Pull Down</b></h2>
        <img src="images/lat-pulldown.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Your first impulse may be to reach for the wide-grip bar, but back-focused EMG research suggests that use of a close neutral grip activates the lats similarly to a regular grip. This grip also allows for a longer range of motion and increased time under tension for the lats, which is great for building muscle.</p>
        <p>Slow down the rep tempo on these, squeeze hard at the bottom of each rep, and allow a good stretch at the top.</p>

        <h2><b>Back Builder #4 – Pull-Ups</b></h2>
        <img src="images/pull-ups.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>It's always a good idea to have an overhead pulling movement in your back routine, and the pull-up is one of the best. Each variation has its own advantages: Wide-grip variations are great for the upper lats, while close-grip chins or neutral-grip pull-ups have a greater stretch and overall range of motion. Mix it up!.</p>
