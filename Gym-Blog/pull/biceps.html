        <br>
        
        <h2><b>Biceps Builder #1 – Barbell Or EZ-Bar Curl</b></h2>
        <img src="images/standing-barbell-curl.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>The standard shoulder-width curl engages the short and long heads of the biceps equally, you can alter grip width to slightly change the emphasis (wide to target the short head, narrow for the long head), you can really pile on the weight, and you don't have to sit there endlessly working one arm at a time.</p>
        <p>Want to use a straight bar instead of a cambered EZ-bar? Have at it, if your wrists don't mind. A 2018 study found that while both variants produced greater activity than dumbbell curls, "The small difference between [barbell] and EZ variants… makes the choice between these two exercises a matter of subjective comfort."</p>
        
        <h2><b>Biceps Builder #2 – Dumbbell Curl</b></h2>
        <img src="images/dumbbell-curl.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Is this really any different than a barbell curl? That's up to you. Sure, you can do the moves in basically the same way in the same workout, but we don't recommend it. The real value of dumbbell curls is that they can be done a number of ways: standing or seated, with both arms or alternating, rotating your wrists into Zottman curls to work on your fearsome forearms, or twisting that pinky up to focus purely on the bis. In short, you have options.</p>
        <p>If you're doing these after barbell or cable curls, emphasize the difference by performing Zottmans, or take bilateral seated curls to fatigue and then extend the set by switching to unilateral curls.</p>

        <h2><b>Biceps Builder #3 – Hammer Curl </b></h2>
        <img src="images/hammer-curl.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Curls with a palms-facing or neutral grip do more than just hit the biceps, they also heavily recruit the brachialis, a muscle that doesn't get measured on EMG studies because it's beneath the biceps. Because it's not as obvious a move as, say, a barbell curl, it often gets undeservedly skipped on arm day.</p>
        <p>Pro tip: The dumbbell version is solid, but even better is the cable version holding a rope grip, because it gives you constant tension throughout the range of motion.</p>

        <h2><b>Biceps Builder #4 – Preacher Curl</b></h2>
        <img src="images/preacher.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>There are many versions of the preacher curl, and every serious physique builder has their fave. Whatever version you do, you'll get a serious pump, particularly if you have a quality pre-workout or pump supplement coursing through your bloodstream at the time. In fact, this old-school peak-builder can be nearly enough for an entire biceps workout, perhaps with something like hammer curls added to it.</p>
        <p>As with other movements that start from a stretched position, you get the most muscle activation during the lower third of the movement. As the weight moves up, the muscle doesn't have to work as hard. This is one reason the cable might be the best implement to use here to help complete your biceps.</p>
